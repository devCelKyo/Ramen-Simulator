Simulation:
-- During a tick, there should be two main entities:
  - Some sort of "CustomerDemandCalculator" that produces customers based on offer and demand
  - An "OrderProcessor" that only processes order queue based on restaurant and employees

-- What happens during a tick?
  - Is a customer entering? Customers enter and place an order based on menu. (based on demand, DemandCalculator produces a customer with an order)
  - OrderProcessor handles orders: if an order is being processed keep doing it, else pop a new order, else sleep.
