Simulation Is One Big Loop:

We simulate restaurants between T_n and T_(n+1) by splitting Duration = T_(n+1) - T_n into N increments (hard defined in simulation)
called ticks

Simulation contains a loop, called main simulation loop, in which all N ticks are played.
-- Inside of the processing of a tick, there should be two main entities:
  - Some sort of "CustomerDemandCalculator" that produces customers based on offer and demand
  - An "OrderProcessor" that only processes order queue based on restaurant and employees

-- What happens during a tick?
  - Is a customer entering? Customers enter and place an order based on menu. (based on demand, DemandCalculator produces a customer with an order)
  - OrderProcessor handles orders: if an order is being processed keep doing it, else pop a new order, else sleep.
